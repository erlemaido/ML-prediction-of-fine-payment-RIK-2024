# ML-prediction-of-fine-payment-RIK

**Predicting which businesses are unlikely to pay their fines**

Team: Erle Maido, Kersti Mikkov, Karl Soosalu, Ants Adamson

We will build an ML model to predict which businesses registered in the Estonian business register are unlikely to pay their fines and to make this prediction even before the fine has been issued. With this model we will give our input into improving the Estonian business environment and making the playground more fair for all participants.
